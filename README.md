### DESIGN

#### Colour Scheme
The three main colours I am proposing to use are an off-white (HEX #f5f5f5), a deep maroon (HEX #4C1130) and a dark gray (HEX #333).  
These colors are refined and muted allowing reflecting the style of music that the performer specialises in.  
The gray and off white alternate as background color and text color to provide easily readable text while not being harsh on the users eye.
The maroon is only used in the header and footer to inject a splash of color.  It links to the color of the braces the musicians wears in the Home pages hero image.

#### Typography
- Fonts:
* Poppins:
* Raleway:  
- Imagery/Videos:
   1. All Hero images used will mainly be action shots of the musician performing/teaching.  
   2. The Home page will feature an image of Tom performing a solo project with letters falling from the ceiling.  
   3. The Teaching page will feature an action shot of the musician with a Student.  
   4. The contact page will feature an active shot of the musician smiling/engaging with others.
   5. The images used on the Ensembles/Projects page will be of the musician performing with that Group.
   6. The images used on the Performances page will be action shots of the musician in concert.
   7. The videos used in the Esembeles/Performances page will be videos of the musicians performing with that group and/or in that project.
